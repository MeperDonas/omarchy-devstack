# devstack — local dev stacks for the Omarchy bar

[![CI](https://github.com/MeperDonas/omarchy-devstack/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/MeperDonas/omarchy-devstack/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

One bar icon in the Omarchy bar (plus a menu section and a CLI) to lift, watch and
drop the local stack of a project: docker services, dev servers, health checks
and the browser, in order.

It ships as an **Omarchy plugin** (`bar-widget`), so it installs with
`omarchy plugin add`, updates with `omarchy plugin update` and is configured from
the Omarchy settings UI. Nothing is hardcoded to one project: you declare each
stack in a JSON file.

While an action runs the icon breathes and the panel shows the dots plus a slow
progress line, so you can see it is working instead of guessing:

![The working animation](docs/working.gif)

The icon is grey when the stack is off, red on error, yellow while lifting and
green when every service answers.

## What it does

- **`up`** walks your services in order: `docker compose up -d` → wait for the
  port → start the dev server → wait for its health URL. Then it opens the
  browser **only if the frontend already answers**, so you never get a tab
  spinning while the bundler compiles the first route.
- **`down`** kills each process **group** (no orphan `nest`/`next` left) and
  brings docker down last. Data volumes are kept.
- **It never touches what it did not start.** A dev server you launched by hand
  is reported as `ajeno`/`ext` and left alone. When you want it out of the way,
  `--force` (or the contextual *Tomar el control* button) kills that PID — with a
  guard so it never kills its own process group.
- **Per-stage notifications** (`Compilando el backend…`, `Backend respondiendo
  (:3001)`, `Stack arriba en 42s`): you always know when it finished, and errors
  notify too.
- **Four-colour state** everywhere: the bar icon, the status chip and one chip
  per service.

| State | Colour | When |
|---|---|---|
| off | grey `#7A8394` | nothing is up |
| error | red `#E05561` | the probe failed, or a service listens and does not answer |
| working | yellow `#E5B454` | lifting / restarting / partially up / compiling the first route |
| ok | green `#7FBF7F` | every service with a health URL responds |

## Where this sits next to the neighbours

The marketplace already has plenty of plugins that *watch* docker or *find*
ports. This one is about **lifting a project's stack in order** — and that is a
different job:

| If you want to… | A plugin like… may be enough |
|---|---|
| see container state, logs, stats | the docker monitor plugins |
| find, open or kill a port that is already listening | the port-discovery plugins (Localhost, Omaports, Portboard, aportless) |
| toggle individual services/commands by hand | Services Manager |
| **declare one project, start its services in order, wait for real health, open the browser when it answers, and stop the whole thing without orphans** | devstack |

devstack also takes over a port that a stray dev server is holding (`--force`),
and never touches a process it did not start.

## Requirements

- Omarchy with plugin support (the bar widget is a `bar-widget` plugin). The CLI
  alone also runs on plain Arch/Hyprland: bash, `jq`, `curl`, `ss` (iproute2).
- `docker` only if you declare docker services.
- For docker without the `docker` group: `polkit` (the Omarchy dialog asks for
  the password) and/or `sudo`.

## Install

One command: the plugin carries the CLI and the example stacks inside the same
clone, so the widget works as soon as it is enabled.

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/MeperDonas/omarchy-devstack --enable
devstack init my-app        # creates ~/.config/devstack/my-app.json from the example
devstack my-app up          # once you edited dir + services
```

Already included, no extra steps: the widget's menu button, the shipped `demo`
stack (`devstack demo up`, a python http.server) and `example`.

Optional extras:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MeperDonas/omarchy-devstack.git && cd omarchy-devstack
./install.sh --menu          # adds the Dev section to the Omarchy menu
./install.sh --project my-app   # points the widget at one project
```

`install.sh` is idempotent, updates the plugin when it is already installed, never
overwrites an existing config, and leaves a backup of every file it edits. Flags:
`--project NAME`, `--config FILE` (repeatable), `--menu`,
`--section left|center|right`, `--no-enable`, `--dry-run`.

Everything else is one `install` away if you want the CLI on `PATH`:

```bash
install -m755 ~/.config/omarchy/plugins/meperdonas.devstack/bin/devstack ~/.local/bin/devstack
```

Uninstall with `./uninstall.sh` (add `--keep-config` to keep your stacks).

## Try it in one minute (no docker, no node)

```bash
DEVDATA_CONFIG="$PWD/config" DEVDATA_PROJECT=demo bin/devstack demo up
```

`config/demo.json` is a single `python3 -m http.server` on `:8080`.

## Point it at any repo

You do not have to write the JSON by hand: the CLI works the stack out and
**proposes** it (read-only — it never executes the project, never elevates, and
never copies `.env` secrets, only ports and local URLs).

```bash
devstack scan ~/Projects/my-app     # proposal + the evidence for every guess
devstack add  ~/Projects/my-app     # writes ~/.config/devstack/my-app.json
```

| Signal | What it infers |
|---|---|
| compose files | one docker service per file: engine, container name, published port |
| `package.json` | Node: Next, Nuxt, SvelteKit, Astro, Vite, CRA, Nest, Express/Fastify/Hono — with the framework's own dev command and port |
| other manifests | Python (FastAPI/uvicorn, Django, Flask), Go, Rust (incl. `trunk`), PHP/Laravel, Ruby/Rails |
| `.env` | its own `PORT`/`APP_URL`, and the backend port the frontend points at (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`) |
| source | Nest's `setGlobalPrefix('api')` → `/api/health`; Prisma → seed/migrate/studio tasks |
| `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, `.opencode/`, `.pi/`, `herdr*` | the commands the repo already documents — the most reliable source in repos that are worked on inside a coding agent |

`scan` prints the reasoning line by line; `add` refuses to overwrite an existing
project, refuses to declare the same directory twice under another name, and is
*idempotent*: running it again on the same directory is not a conflict, it just tells you
it was already declared (`--force` overwrites, `--name <otro>` declares the same directory
under another name).
project and refuses to declare the same directory twice under another name.

### Follow the session (auto mode)

The widget can show the stack of **the terminal you are looking at** instead of a
fixed project:

```bash
devstack here json --window   # what the widget calls every 5 s
devstack here json --window --fallback myapp   # …and answer with myapp if nothing resolves
devstack here status          # the project of the terminal you are in
devstack here up              # lift the stack of the project you are standing in
devstack here down            # …and drop it
```

`here` reads the working directory of the focused window (walking the process tree of
the active window, so it works with any terminal — Omarchy's helper only knows kitty —
and then asking `omarchy-cmd-terminal-cwd`), maps it to the declared project that contains it —
longest match wins, so a subdirectory is still its project — and forwards any
subcommand there. An undeclared repo shows up in the widget as
`Sin declarar · <repo>` with a **Declarar este stack** button that runs the
detector in a terminal, so you see what it inferred before anything is written.
If nothing resolves (you are looking at the browser, not a terminal)
`--fallback <project>` answers with that project *in the same call* — the widget
passes its `project` setting that way, so one probe resolves everything and the
state never blinks; `mode: fixed` pins one project like before.

Path resolution only looks at *your* projects (`~/.config/devstack`): the examples
that ship with the plugin are for trying things out, not for deciding where you are.

### When the detection gets it wrong (or you just want to decide)

Resolution is a short chain and every step is a manual override:

1. **the terminal you are looking at** — `mode: auto`, `devstack here json --window`;
2. **the `project` setting** of the widget, which travels as `--fallback <project>`;
3. **the project of the house** — `devstack use <project>`. That is just the file
   `~/.config/devstack/default`, which plain `devstack json` also reads when you
   have several projects and pass no name;
4. nothing — the widget says *Sin proyecto · elegí uno abajo* and lists your projects
   so you can pick one.

You never have to leave the bar: **click a row** in the popup to pin that project (the
widget stops following the terminal) and **Seguir el foco** to go back. The pin is
stored with `devstack use`, so it survives a shell restart and the CLI agrees with
what the bar shows:

```bash
devstack use            # which project is the house project
devstack use meperpos   # make it this one
devstack use --clear    # forget it: back to the focused terminal
```

And when you would rather go looking yourself, the popup has a **Buscar proyectos**
button: it runs `devstack find`, which walks your project folders (`~/Projects` by
default; `DEVDATA_SEARCH_ROOTS` with `:` for more, `--depth` for deeper trees) and
lists every repo with a stack it can recognise — the ones you already declared first,
with their live state. Candidates are labelled with their path inside the search root
(`MeperPOS-loans-module`, `Proyecto de Grado/gestion-inventario-app`), so two `backend`
folders never look the same; a directory whose stack is already covered by its parent
is not offered again. Clicking a declared one lifts it (and pins it); clicking one
that is not declared yet declares it *and* lifts it in a terminal, so you see what
the detector inferred before anything is written.

```bash
devstack find                      # repos with a stack in ~/Projects (writes nothing)
devstack find --json               # the same, machine-readable (what the widget reads)
devstack find ~/code ~/work --depth 3
```

For something permanent, use `mode: fixed` plus `project` in the widget entry, or
point the whole widget at any CLI invocation with the `command` setting
(`command: "DEVDATA_CONFIG=/tmp/lab devstack"`).

### Every project at a glance

```bash
devstack all status     # one line per project: up/total plus a per-service state
devstack all json       # the same, machine-readable (what mode: all reads)
devstack all up         # lift what is missing, project by project
devstack all down       # stop everything
```

`mode: all` in the widget turns the icon into an aggregate — the glyph plus `N/M`
— and the popup into one row per project with **Levantar lo que falta** and
**Bajar todo**. Only projects *you* declared count; the examples shipped with the
plugin stay out.

In `auto` and `fixed` the same rows appear at the top of the popup as a **project
selector**: the one being shown is in bold, a click on a row pins that project
(the widget stops following the terminal; **Seguir el foco** goes back), and the
row's `▶`/`⏻` button lifts or drops just that project.

Two of your projects declaring the same port is warned about in `devstack all status`,
and the widget shows it under the service chips (`:3000 compartido con otro proyecto`)
— the one listening may be the other project's process, so a stack can look "up" when
what answers is its neighbour.

A service that is listening but never answers the health check is reported as
`Servicio sin responder` and the "lifting" state is dropped there: without that,
an action that can never finish would keep the 2-second polling and the progress
sweep running for the whole timeout.

### Let your coding agents drive the stacks (MCP)

`bin/devstack-mcp` is an MCP server over stdio (bash + jq, no dependencies)
exposing `devstack_list`, `devstack_status`, `devstack_here`, `devstack_scan`,
`devstack_declare`, `devstack_up`, `devstack_down` and `devstack_logs`: an agent
can see your stacks, start what is missing, diagnose a failure from the logs and
stop things again, with the same guarantees as the CLI (nothing it did not start
gets touched). `devstack_up` starts detached and returns immediately — the agent
follows with `devstack_status`.

```jsonc
// Claude Code — or: claude mcp add devstack -- /home/USER/.local/bin/devstack-mcp
// ~/.claude.json (or a project .mcp.json)
{ "mcpServers": { "devstack": { "type": "stdio", "command": "/home/USER/.local/bin/devstack-mcp" } } }

// opencode — ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json, next to your other MCP entries
{ "mcp": { "devstack": { "type": "local", "command": ["/home/USER/.local/bin/devstack-mcp"], "enabled": true } } }

// codex — ~/.codex/config.toml
[mcp_servers.devstack]
command = "/home/USER/.local/bin/devstack-mcp"
```

Any client that speaks MCP over stdio works the same way: the command is
`devstack-mcp` (omp, pi, herdr, … included).

## Configure a stack

`~/.config/devstack/<name>.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "MeperPOS",
  "dir": "~/Projects/MeperPOS",
  "services": [
    { "id": "db", "label": "postgres", "type": "docker",
      "compose": "backend/docker-compose.yml", "container": "postgres-db",
      "port": 5432, "wait": 60 },

    { "id": "api", "label": "backend", "dir": "backend", "cmd": "npm run start:dev",
      "port": 3001, "health": "http://localhost:3001/api/health", "wait": 180 },

    { "id": "web", "label": "frontend", "dir": "frontend", "cmd": "npm run dev",
      "port": 3000, "health": "http://localhost:3000", "wait": 120, "open": true }
  ],
  "tasks": [
    { "id": "seed", "label": "Seed data", "dir": "backend",
      "cmd": "npm run seed", "needs": ["db"] }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | short id used by the CLI and the bar (`devstack myproject restart api`) |
| `label` | what you see in the chips and in `status` |
| `type` | `process` (default) or `docker` |
| `dir` | service working dir, relative to `dir` |
| `cmd` | command to run (`process`) — launched with `setsid`, logged to a pidfile |
| `compose` / `container` | compose file and container name (`docker`) |
| `port` | port that must open before the next service starts |
| `health` | URL polled until it answers 2xx; also drives the green state |
| `url` | URL to open with `devstack <p> open` (falls back to `health`) |
| `wait` | seconds to wait for port/health (scaled by `DEVDATA_WAIT_SCALE`) |
| `open` | `true` on the service the browser button should open |
| `tasks[].needs` | services to lift before running the task |

## CLI

```bash
devstack                          # list configured projects
devstack <p> up [--force]         # lift everything (--force takes foreign ports)
devstack <p> down [--keep-docker] [--force]
devstack <p> restart [id ...] [--force]
devstack <p> status               # per-service state, owner PID, URLs
devstack <p> json                 # machine-readable state (what the bar reads)
devstack <p> logs [id]            # follow logs
devstack <p> open [id]
devstack <p> task <id>            # seed, migrate, studio, …
devstack <p> up <id ...>          # lift only some services
devstack <p> list                 # declared services and tasks
devstack <p> menu                 # print the JSONC block for the Omarchy menu
devstack <p> --running | --up | --foreign   # guards for the menu
```

`DEVDATA_CONFIG` (config dir), `DEVDATA_PROJECT` (default project),
`DEVDATA_WAIT_SCALE` (multiply waits) and `DEVDATA_NOTIFY` (`all` | `final` |
`off`) override the defaults.

### Notifications

The panel already shows the progress (state chip, one chip per service, the
working animation), so notifications only carry the **outcome** when an action
comes from the bar: `Stack arriba en 42s`, `Stack parcial…`, or the error. That
is what keeps the popup from covering a pile of its own "compiling…" notices —
Omarchy anchors notifications next to the bar, exactly where the widget lives.

- `final` (default in the widget): only the outcome.
- `all`: every stage (useful from the menu or a terminal, where there is no panel).
- `off`: silence.

Set it per widget instance in the Omarchy settings UI (`notifyMode`) or with
`DEVDATA_NOTIFY` on any CLI call.

## Several projects on the bar

`allowMultiple` is on, so you can run one widget instance per project. Add the
widget again from the Omarchy settings UI (or `omarchy plugin enable
meperdonas.devstack --section right`) and give each instance its `project` in
`~/.config/omarchy/shell.json`:

```json
{ "id": "meperdonas.devstack", "project": "meperpos" },
{ "id": "meperdonas.devstack", "project": "other-app" }
```

The widget also reads the project the CLI resolved, so a single instance with no
`project` set follows whichever project is the default.

## How it is wired

```mermaid
graph LR
  W["bar plugin<br/>meperdonas.devstack<br/>(poll 5 s)"] -- "devstack json" --> S["~/.local/bin/devstack"]
  M["Omarchy menu<br/>(dev.* rows)"] -- "bash -lc" --> S
  T["terminal"] --> S
  S --> PG[("docker compose")]
  S --> BE["dev servers (setsid)"]
  S -.-> RT["/run/user/$UID/devstack/<project>/<br/>*.log *.pid"]
```

## Caveats

- Services live **inside your user session** (`/run/user/$UID/devstack/`): a
  reboot or a session logout takes them down. That is intentional — nothing
  survives behind your back.
- `--force` kills processes that are not devstack's. It is opt-in for a reason.
- Health checks are plain HTTP; a service that answers slowly will read as
  "compiling" and turn yellow until it responds.

**Qué es.** Un icono en la barra de Omarchy (más una sección en el menú y un CLI)
para levantar, mirar y bajar el stack local de un proyecto: docker, servidores de
desarrollo, health checks y el navegador, en orden.

**Instalar.**

```bash
omarchy plugin add https://github.com/MeperDonas/omarchy-devstack --enable
devstack init mi-app        # crea ~/.config/devstack/mi-app.json desde el ejemplo
devstack mi-app up
```

El plugin trae adentro el CLI y los stacks de ejemplo, así que no hace falta
clonar ni copiar nada: el widget funciona apenas se habilita. Para el menú de
Omarchy: `./install.sh --menu`.

Es un **plugin de Omarchy** (`bar-widget`): se instala con `omarchy plugin add`,
se actualiza con `omarchy plugin update` y se configura desde los ajustes de
Omarchy. Para probarlo sin docker ni node: `DEVDATA_CONFIG="$PWD/config"
DEVDATA_PROJECT=demo bin/devstack demo up` (levanta un `python3 -m http.server`).
Desinstalar: `./uninstall.sh`.

**Guiarlo a mano.** La resolución es una cadena corta y cada paso se puede forzar:
la **terminal que mirás** (`mode: auto`), el ajuste **`project`** del widget (viaja
como `--fallback`), el **proyecto de casa** (`devstack use <p>`, o sea el archivo
`~/.config/devstack/default`, que también usa `devstack json` cuando hay varios
proyectos y no pasás nombre) y, si no hay nada, el widget dice *Sin proyecto · elegí
uno abajo* y lista tus proyectos. Sin salir de la barra: **un click en un renglón**
fija ese proyecto y **Seguir el foco** vuelve; el pin se guarda con `devstack use`,
así sobrevive al reinicio del shell y el CLI queda de acuerdo con la barra
(`devstack use`, `devstack use meperpos`, `devstack use --clear`). Para algo
permanente: `mode: fixed` + `project` en la entrada del widget, o apuntá el widget
entero a cualquier invocación del CLI con el ajuste `command`.

**Ojo con los puertos.** Si dos de tus proyectos declaran el mismo puerto,
`devstack all status` lo avisa y el widget lo muestra bajo los chips (*:3000
compartido con otro proyecto*): el que escucha puede ser el proceso del otro, así
que un stack puede verse "arriba" cuando el que contesta es el vecino.

**Buscar en vez de esperar.** El botón *Buscar proyectos* del popup corre
`devstack find`: recorre tus carpetas (`~/Projects` por defecto; `DEVDATA_SEARCH_ROOTS`
con `:` para varias, `--depth` para bajar más) y lista cada repo con stack
reconocible — primero los que ya declaraste, con su estado en vivo y etiquetados con
su ruta dentro de la carpeta buscada (`MeperPOS-loans-module`, `Proyecto de
Grado/gestion-inventario-app`), así dos `backend` nunca se confunden ni se repiten. Un click en uno
declarado lo levanta (y lo fija); en uno sin declarar, lo declara *y* lo levanta en
una terminal, así ves lo que propone el detector antes de que escriba nada.
`devstack find --json` es lo que lee el widget.

**Todos a la vista.** `devstack all status|json|up|down` resume tus proyectos
(arriba/total por proyecto) y con `mode: all` el icono de la barra muestra el
glifo + `N/M` y el popup una fila por proyecto con *Levantar lo que falta* y
*Bajar todo*. En `auto` y `fixed` esas mismas filas son el **selector**: la que
se está mostrando va en negrita, un click fija ese proyecto (el widget deja de
seguir la terminal; *Seguir el foco* vuelve) y su botón `▶`/`⏻` levanta o baja
sólo ese proyecto.

**Para los agentes (MCP).** `devstack-mcp` es un servidor MCP por stdio (bash +
jq) con `list/status/here/scan/declare/up/down/logs`: omp, opencode, claude,
codex, pi o herdr pueden mirar y manejar tus stacks solos. Se registra con el
comando `/home/USER/.local/bin/devstack-mcp` (mirá los ejemplos del README en
inglés para Claude Code, opencode y codex).

**Seguir tu sesión (modo auto).** Por defecto el widget muestra el stack de la
**terminal que estás mirando**: `devstack here json --window` resuelve la carpeta
de la ventana activa **recorriendo su árbol de procesos** (funciona con cualquier
terminal; la herramienta de Omarchy sólo conoce kitty) y, si no, pregunta a
`omarchy-cmd-terminal-cwd`; la mapea al proyecto
declarado que la contiene y reenvía ahí cualquier subcomando (`devstack here up`
levanta lo que estás mirando). Si el repo no está declarado, el widget lo dice con
un botón para declararlo con el detector; si no hay nada que resolver, el
respaldo del ajuste `project` viaja como `--fallback` en la misma llamada (así
el estado no parpadea entre dos sondas). Con `mode: fixed` queda clavado como
antes.

Un servicio que escucha pero nunca contesta el health se reporta como *Servicio
sin responder* y ahí se suelta el estado de "levantando": si no, una acción que
no puede terminar dejaría el sondeo en 2 s y la barrita de progreso dando vueltas
hasta el timeout entero.

**Detectar en vez de escribir.** `devstack scan <dir>` propone el stack de
cualquier repo (compose, `package.json`, `.env`, código, y los comandos que
documenta su `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`) y `devstack add <dir>` lo declara. Sólo
lee: no ejecuta el proyecto, no eleva permisos y no copia secretos del `.env`.

**Configurar.** Un JSON por proyecto en `~/.config/devstack/<nombre>.json`
(nombre, directorio y `services` con `id`, `label`, `type` (`process`/`docker`),
`dir`, `cmd`, `port`, `health`, `url`, `wait`, `open`; más `tasks` opcionales).
Mirá la tabla de campos de arriba y `config/example.json`.

**Usar.** `devstack` lista los proyectos; `devstack <p> up|down|restart|status|
logs|open|task`. Desde la barra: un click y los botones. Cuatro colores: gris
apagado, rojo error, amarillo trabajando, verde arriba.

**Avisos.** El panel ya muestra el progreso, así que desde la barra sólo llega
el **resultado** (`final`, por defecto) y no una notificación por etapa que
además quedaría encima del panel. `all` para todo, `off` para silencio
(ajuste `notifyMode` del widget, o `DEVDATA_NOTIFY` en el CLI).

**Dónde encaja.** El marketplace ya tiene plugins que *miran* docker o *encuentran* puertos (Localhost, Omaports, Portboard, aportless, Services Manager). Este es para **levantar el stack de un proyecto en orden**: declarás los servicios, espera la salud real de cada uno, abre el navegador cuando contesta y baja todo sin dejar huérfanos.

**Lo importante.** No toca procesos que no levantó él (los marca `ajeno`/`ext`),
no deja `nest`/`next` huérfanos y avisa por notificación en cada etapa. Con
`--force` (o el botón *Tomar el control*) mata lo ajeno que ocupe un puerto.
